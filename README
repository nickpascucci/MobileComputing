Welcome to the Mobile Computing repository!

My name is Nick Pascucci; I own the place. I'm a student at the Colorado College
and I'm taking a class in Mobile/Pervasive computing. This repository stores my
class assignments and code, and can act as a resource for other people
interested in the topic as well as make sharing and collaboration easier for my 
classmates.

Feel free to use any of this code, but please comply with the MIT license for
it. Also, please don't plagiarize my work for a school assignment; it's just not
cool.

Tips:
Each assignment has its own directory with a Makefile. If unit tests are
included, run "make test" to run them. "make dist" will tar up all of the
relevant files into a tar.gz archive. Read the Makefiles for more targets to
run.

A lot of the assignments will be in Python; non-executable files don't have a
main function and can't be run independently. You can, however, use them in the
interpreter if you add the directory created by cloning this repository (or any
parent thereof) to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Happy Hacking!
